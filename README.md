# WP-Plugin-Age
WP-Plugin-Age helps you find the age of a WordPress plugin which are available in the default WP plugin directory. It's really simple. 

## Features
The plugin is lightweight but delivers all the details which a user requires while finding out how old is a plugin. It provides with the info like:
1. Exact date when the plugin got added in the YEAR-MM-DAY format.
2. The total age of the plugin i.e. years-months-days.
3. Number of times the plugin is downloaded.
4. Download link for the plugin.

## Finding the Age of a Plugin 

The plugin functions in the most flexible way. Just enter your WordPress plugin slug in the field provided and hit the "Find" button. That's about it.
